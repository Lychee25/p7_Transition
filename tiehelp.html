        <p>Norbertina walked out of their room and went to their big sister: [enter name]. Luckily, she is in high school as well, and knows how to tie a tie!</p>
        <p>They both then tie their tie, and Norbertina now knows how to tie a tie!</p>

        <p>They then run out of their house, checking the time as they left: 0810 - perfect. They slow to a fast walking pace and see two groups of people:<br>
         Their friends from their old school, and the people they met from the transition events.</p>
         <p>Does Norbertina walk with their old friends that aren't in any of their classes, or attempt to make friends with the people they are going to be stuck with for the next six years?</p>
