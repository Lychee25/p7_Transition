        <p>Norbertina and their friends book it and start sprinting to class. As they skid past the stairs, right into Ms. Ross. Uh oh.</p>
        <p>They get a sharp talking to, but in the end get out of it because it is their first day. They get told to walk to class, and to not run in the corridors. It really is a pain for everyone when you run in the halls. Do not run in the halls. It really is annoying.</p>
