         <p>Norbertina rushes out of their room in a flurry, deciding that getting to school is worth more than wearing a tie. Just before they run out of the house, their mom stops them and reminds them to put on a tie. When they say they do not know how to do so, mother tied it for them -- with a stern reminder to learn how to do it when they get home.</p>
         <p>They run out of their house, checking the time as they left: 0810 - perfect. They slow to a fast walking pace and see two groups of people:<br>
         Their friends from their old school, and the people they met from the transition events.</p>
         <p>Does Norbertina walk with their old friends that aren't in any of their classes, or attempt to make friends with the people they are going to be stuck with for the next six years?</p>
